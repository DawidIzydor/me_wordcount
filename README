A simple project in C# that counts how many times a word appears in songs
It take lyrics from tekstowo.pl

USAGE:
Type ARTIST - TITLE, one entry per line, then click the only one big button. It then saves the output to "D:/cloud/OneDrive - Uniwersytet Jagiellonski/Documents/WordsCount.txt"

Known bugs:
- Does not work if a song has "-" in either ARTIST or TITLE (since it splits the string by the character '-'
